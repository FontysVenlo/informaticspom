# informaticspom

The `informaticspom` is used as the parent pom for programming assignments at Fontys Venlo. 

The goal of the `POM` is to have a baseline of dependencies that are needed for most assignments.

These include:

1. Test dependencies
    - JUnit
    - AssertJ
    - Mockito
2. CodeCoverage with JaCoCo
3. Static code analyzer
    - PMD
4. JavaFX (with the JavaFX profile)
5. Testing modular JPMS projects

## Usage

The pom can be used by defining it as the parent pom

```
<parent>
    <groupId>io.github.fontysvenlo</groupId>  
    <artifactId>informaticspom</artifactId>
    <version>0.8</version>
</parent>
```

## Profiles

**Default**: The default dependencies (no JavaFX and doesn't generate code coverage)  
**Jacoco**: Same as default, but generates the code coverage report  
**JavaFX**: Includes the JavaFX dependencies  
**Release**: Use to 
release new version of the `informaticspom`

## Publishing

Releasing is as easy as pushing new changes to this repository, when the build passes all the checks it will automatically release a new version on Maven Central.
